# My Frist Website
This is the first website I created during my first year studying Computer Science. 
It was build using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it shows my very early steps into web development.

## Overview
The website showcases a Moroccan-inspireded theme with:
- A Home page introducing the culture and cuisine
- A Recipes page displaying traditional dishes with images
- A Contact oae with a simple form
- Basic JavaScript interactions for dynamic content

## Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I learned how to:
- Structure and link multiple pages using HTML and CSS
- Implement interactivity using JavaScript
- Work with images, lists, navigation menus, and forms
- Develop clean and semantic code with attention to design

Although a very simple project, it marked my first experience with building a complete, multi-page website from scratch.
